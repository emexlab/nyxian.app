## Quickstart

```bash
./quickstart.sh
```

This script setups everything for you.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

### Github Pages

You can find an automatic build of the newest state at https://projectnyxian.github.io/nyxian.app/

### SSH

```bash
./deploy.sh user@host
```

This will build the site and upload it via ssh to the specified host as the specified user.

> [!NOTE]
> It’s recommended to set up SSH keys beforehand. Otherwise, you’ll be prompted for your SSH password three times during deployment.
